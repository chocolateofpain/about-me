    <h1>About me...</h1>
    <p>My passions are technology, languages and storytelling. A former film student I'm now a web developer working mainly with Javascript, React, Redux and SCSS. Additionally I have experience with Node.js, TypeScript, Tailwind and Elm.
    Above all I love learning about new technologies and finding elegant and pragmatic solutions to challenges.</p>
